# Change Log
Significant changes to the Ounce of Rust project manual are described here.


## Rev B - 2019-11-27

### Requirements

* **Changed:** Know Squares that Contributed to Playerâ€™s Victory requirement to 
  clarify that in the event the player won by having more than one row, column, 
  or diagonal all the squares are provided.

#### Design

* **Added:** Size struct to represent board sizes.
* **Removed:**  Square struct as this data is redundant.
* **Changed:** Game struct so it provides access to free squares instead of the
  Board struct. 
* **Changed:** Victory sets are represented by the Rust HashSet instead of having
  a custom type.
* **Changed:** AIMove struct is renamed to AIOpponent. The AIOpponent struct
  is not intended to be recreated every move like the old AIMove was.
* **Changed:** Public APIs now prefer to return an Error Result or None Option 
  type instead of panicking.  
* **Changed:** The continuous integration system enforces documentation for 
  public APIs instead of making the Rust compiler do this check.
