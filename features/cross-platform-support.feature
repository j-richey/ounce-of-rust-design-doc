Feature: Cross Platform Support

  | As a Rust application developer,
  | I want the library to work on a variety of platforms,
  | so I can make Tic Tac Toe games for a wider use base.

  The use of platform specific code is minimized, however, the number of platforms
  the library is tested on may be limited due to resource constraints.
