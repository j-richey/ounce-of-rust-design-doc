Feature: Idiomatic Rust APIs

  | As a Rust application developer,
  | I want the library to provide idiomatic Rust APIs,
  | so the library works in natural and familiar way.

  API design can be subjective. However, providing an idiomatic Rust API is important
  to fulfilling the :ref:`ref-learn-about-rust-objective` objective. Therefore,
  obtaining the opinions of an experienced Rust programmer helps ensure the resulting
  design is reasonable and idiomatic.
