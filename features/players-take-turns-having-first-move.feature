Feature: Players Take Turns Having the First Move

  | As a Tic Tac Toe player,
  | I want to have the first move on the next game if I did not have the first move this game,
  | so I have a better chance of winning the next game.

  The player who takes the first move has more wining possibilities than the
  second player.
