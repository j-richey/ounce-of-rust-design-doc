Feature: Game State Management

  | As a Rust application developer,
  | I want the library to contain functionality for managing the state of the game,
  | so I can focus on creating engaging user experiences.

  **Note:** the design details of the APIs are outside the scope of this requirements chapter.

  Scenario: Get the current game state
  Scenario: Update the game state
  Scenario: Determine the player that won the game
